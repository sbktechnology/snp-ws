<p><span style="line-height: 1.3em;">Coconut trees are found throughout the tropics. They are known as the Tree of Life because all parts of the coconut tree are used. The trunk, bark and other parts of the tree itself are used for building fundamental products such as houses and boats, as well as other products such as ropes, industrial gas masks, engine cleaners, and cigarette filters. The fruit gives milk, water, flesh, sugar and oil all of which have countless uses. In many countries, coconut is a staple of the diet, used in a majority of dishes, whether in the cooking process, or as an added ingredient. Some uses we may not readily associate with coconut are hair conditioners, cosmetics and healing salves. Common uses include flavorings for drinks, oil for cooking, and flakes and cream for endless delicious desserts and other dishes.</span></p>
