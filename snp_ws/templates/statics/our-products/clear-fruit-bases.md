<p align="justify">Spectrum Fruits's Clear Fruit Base ingredients are 100% concentrates of fruit sugar. These pure sugar concentrates are derived from fruit juice or extract by removing the color, flavor, pulp, and acid. Spectrum Fruits offers Clear Fruit Base-<strong>Pineapple (SP-72)</strong>, as well as Clear Fruit Base-<strong>Apple (SP-5000)</strong> and Clear Fruit Base-<strong>Pear (SP-5010)</strong>. Products like corn syrup and agave syrup, commonly used as sweeteners, are enzymatically synthesized from starches and contain higher levels of fructose than Clear Fruit Base. Clear Fruit Bases, by contrast, are simply purified fruit sugar concentrates. From the standpoint of reducing rates of obesity and diabetes, Clear Fruit Base-Pineapple presents the healthiest option.</p>
