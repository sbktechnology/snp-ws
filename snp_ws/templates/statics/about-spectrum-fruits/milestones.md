<p align="justify"><b>History & Milestones</b></p>
<p align="justify">Dr. Chareonsri Srisangnam (Sri) founded Spectrum Fruits, Inc. in 1985. For ten years, she worked aggressively with producers and buyers to develop numerous unique specifications of fruit, juice and pulp to fit market needs. As a result, producers began to send Spectrum Fruits their own products for feedback on quality issues. Spectrum Fruits became known as the problem-solver of the industry.</p>
<p align="justify">Spectrum Fruits’s business continued to grow, and in 1994, Dr. Vinod Padhye joined Dr. Srisangnam.&nbsp; Today, Spectrum Fruits supplies premium niche ingredients such as prickly pear and nopal purées and powders, tamarind concentrate, Alphonso mango purée, and Clear Fruit Bases™ made from pineapple, pear, and apple. Our product line also includes temperate ingredients like berry purées and raisins, as well as Florida and California citrus products. Throughout the years, Spectrum Fruits has contributed development expertise to brand-name and award-winning products.</p>
