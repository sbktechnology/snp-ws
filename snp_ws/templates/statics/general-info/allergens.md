<p align="justify">Our fruit products are processed in plants that process only fruit; they are free of allergens such as peanuts, milk, tree nuts, eggs, wheat, soy, fish, animal fats, seeds (cottonseed, sesame), tartrazine, and MSG.</p>
<p align="justify">Many dried fruits are treated with SO2 (sulfur dioxide) to protect the color and flavor of products that are intended to be stored. Because some people are allergic to SO2, Spectrum Fruits developed both low-SO2 products (&lt;150 ppm) and no-SO2 products (&lt;10 ppm) for customers with health concerns. These products are readily available from Spectrum Fruits.</p>
<p align="justify">Spectrum Fruits also carries nuts as part of our ProSunÂ® snack line.  Nuts are a common source of allergies.  Spectrum Fruits's nuts and fruit products are processed in separate facilities.</p>
