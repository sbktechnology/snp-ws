#History & Milestones 
<p>Dr. Chareonsri Srisangnam (Sri) founded S&amp;P Marketing, Inc. in 1985. For ten years, she worked aggressively with producers and buyers to develop numerous unique specifications of fruit, juice and pulp to fit market needs. As a result, producers began to send S&amp;P Marketing their own products for feedback on quality issues. S&amp;P became known as the problem-solver of the industry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>S&amp;P’s business continued to grow, and in 1994, Dr. Vinod Padhye joined Dr. Srisangnam.&nbsp; Today, S&amp;P Marketing supplies premium niche ingredients such as prickly pear and nopal purées and powders, tamarind concentrate, Alphonso mango purée, and Clear Fruit Bases™ made from pineapple, pear, and apple. Our product line also includes temperate ingredients like berry purées and raisins, as well as Florida and California citrus products. Throughout the years, S&amp;P has contributed development expertise to brand-name and award-winning products.</p>
